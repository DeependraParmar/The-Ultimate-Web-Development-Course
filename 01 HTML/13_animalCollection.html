    <p>In this video, we are going to create a project which is named as Animal Collection in which, we are going to
        create a table containing images of animals along with its description.</p>
    <table border="1">

        <thead>
            <tr>

                <td>The lion is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a muscular,
                    broad-chested body; short,
                    rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult
                    male lions are larger
                    than females and have a prominent mane.</td>

                elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. They are the only surviving members of the family

                and the largest ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes were thought to be one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with
                nine subspecies.</td>

                wolves, and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. Dogs were the first species to be domesticated by
                hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago before the development of agriculture</td>
